## Self Review

Write a technical paper on each topic listed below.

All technical papers should be:
1. in markdown format
2. hosted in a single folder on Gitlab.
3. Use your own words and your own examples.
4. This is for your own revision. Do not copy paste from internet or each other.
5. Less words is appreciated. Make sure it is to the point.
6. Focus more on code samples and codeblocks.

Share link of the folder in your private Discord channel when you start. Also just drop a message when each technical paper is completed.

### Topics:
- different datatypes in JavaScript
- scopes in javaScript
- let, var, const
- why we must not use var
- why using global variables is bad
- truthy and falsy values
- function hoisting
- what happens when a function does not have a return statement
- different ways of declaring a function
- pass by reference and pass by value - add codeblocks
- different types of for loops - for with numbers, for..in, for..of, forEach, while
- searching mdn (mozilla developer network)
- popular array utility methods - add codeblocks and mention mutable/immutable
  - **Basics**:
  - Array.pop
  - Array.push
  - Array.concat
  - Array.slice
  - Array.splice
  - Array.join
  - Array.flat
  - **Finding**:
  - Array.find
  - Array.indexOf
  - Array.includes
  - Array.findIndex
  - **Higher Order Functions**:
  - Array.forEach
  - Array.filter
  - Array.map
  - Array.reduce
  - Array.sort
  - **Advanced**:
  - Array methods chaining
- popular string utility methods - add codeblocks and mention mutable/immutable
- popular object utility methods - add codeblocks and mention mutable/immutable
- when to use forEach, when to use array utility methods like map, filter, reduce
- immutable and mutable methods
- error handling (try catch)
- throwing errors
- difference between throw new Error("Error message here") and throw "Error message here
- reading error messages and tracing issues from the stack trace when errors happen - practice this daily for 2 weeks with different examples. this is very important
- importance of catch block
- spread operator
- template literals
- default parameters
- destructuring
- closures
- difference between arrow functions and regular functions
- difference between === and ==
- why using value === undefined is better than using !value
- array utility methods chaining
- difference between null and undefined
- importing and exporting modules using require and module.exports
- the different methods of console such as console.log, console.error, console.info and so on
- all the best practices mentioned on the LMS - indendation, variable naming, loop variable naming and all the others
- passing functions to other functions and invoking them on demand
- differences between named functions and anonymous functions
- variable number of arguments passed to functions
- debugging strategies
