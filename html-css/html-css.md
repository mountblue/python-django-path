## 12. Project I: Green Tree Initiative

* Project Adobe XD wireframes - [Wireframes](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/a75faa97-2d9f-401c-6140-8fac4a6601aa-d16e/grid/)
* Project assets - [Assets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1raP7YpOF4knQnX7UWOYJYoTU4KSGJAyy?usp=share_link)

Build the two pages - home page and donation page.

Get the layout and positioning right first before jumping into details. Link the pages among themselves for navigation.

### Hosting

Host your website on Netlify.

### Some pointers:

* Please work *mobile-first*.
* Mostly use flexbox or grid.
* Add README.md and .gitignore files to your repository.
* Make a common styles.css. Include it on each HTML page. Put the style classes here. They can be gradually reused.
* Structural CSS should be different for each page.
* Work page by page, section by section, element by element. Break things down to the smallest step. Ask yourself what you don't know and figure it out.
* Try to work with high energy and complete things.

### CSS Specific:

*  Always make the mobile resolution working first, then tablet, then webpage.
* Separate out classes for structure and style.
* Get the structure - layout and positioning right first before jumping into styling details.
* Use structural CSS (like flex and grid) in a way to avoid too much responsive logic.
* Link the pages among themselves for navigation.
* Use Flexbox and Grid as much as possible. Minimise use of positioning - relative or absolute.
* Use rem for font-size. Don't use em, px, vh or vw.
* Understand "in-the-flow" and "out-of-flow".
* Anything specific width, height, top, left, right, bottom, positioning: (absolute, fixed or float) can break the flow. Use when necessary e.g. overlapping elements.
* Try to avoid using width as much as possible. Use percentages for sections inside containers.
* Try to limit use of height wherever necessary.

### Submission

This section requires you to submit the following URLs:
