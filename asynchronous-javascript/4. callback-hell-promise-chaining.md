# Callback-Hell and Chaining of Promises

## What is the difference between Callbacks and Promises?
The main difference between Callback Functions and Promises is that we attach a callback to a Promise rather than passing it. So we still use callback functions with Promises, but in a different way (chaining).

This is one of the greatest advantages of using Promises, but why?

## What is Chaining?
Callback functions have been used alone for asynchronous operations in JavaScript for many years. But in some cases, using Promises can be a better option.

If there are multiple async operations to be done and if we try to use good-old Callbacks for them, weâ€™ll find ourselves quickly inside a situation called Callback hell:

```javascript
firstRequest(function(response) {
    secondRequest(response, function(nextResponse) {
        thirdRequest(nextResponse, function(finalResponse) {
            console.log('Final response: ' + finalResponse);
        }, failureCallback);
    }, failureCallback);
}, failureCallback);
```
However if we handle the same operation with Promises, since we can attach Callbacks rather than passing them, this time the same code above looks much cleaner and easier to read:

```javascript
firstRequest()
  .then(function(response) {
    return secondRequest(response);
}).then(function(nextResponse) {
    return thirdRequest(nextResponse);
}).then(function(finalResponse) {
    console.log('Final response: ' + finalResponse);
}).catch(failureCallback);
```
The code just above shows how multiple callbacks can be chained one after another. Chaining is one of the best features of Promises.
