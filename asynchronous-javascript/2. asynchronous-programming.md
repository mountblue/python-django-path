## Best Practices: if else

Bad Usage:

```javascript
fs.readFile(filePath, "utf-8", (err, data) => {
    if(err) {
        console.error(err);
    }

    console.log(data);
});
```

Good Usage:

```javascript
fs.readFile(filePath, "utf-8", (err, data) => {
    if(err) {
        console.error(err);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

The reason why the bad usage is considered bad is because if we were to run any operations on the `data` variable on line 6 such as `data.length`, it would work when the operation is successful.

But when it is not, the bad structure will not stop the `data.length` operation from running, and because it will be `undefined`, it will cause your code to crash.

It can be prevented by using `return` inside the `if` but it is easier to just use the good usage example as you will not fall prey to forgetting the `return` when you use the good structure.
