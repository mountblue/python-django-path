# IPL Project

## Best Practices: Imports

When you import a module, always name the module the same as the file name or it's installed module name. That way it becomes easier to debug when the code becomes more complex.

If you are using [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), this does not apply.

Bad Usage:
```javascript
const functions = require("./ipl");

functions.mostManOfTheMatch();
```

Good Usage:
```javascript
const ipl = require("./ipl");

ipl.mostManOfTheMatch();
```

## Best Practices: Semi-Colon Usage

Javascript is not a very strict language. So it allows you to use semi-colons if you want. It also allows you to skip it if you want. However, it is always a good idea to stay consistent in that usage.

So,

If you are using `;`, use it everywhere.

If you not are using `;`, do not use it everywhere.

Bad Usage:
```javascript
let factor = 2
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let computedNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
    console.log(number);
    return (number * factor)
})
```

Good Usage:
```javascript
let factor = 2;
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

let computedNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
    console.log(number);
    return (number * factor);
})
```

Alternative Good Usage:
```javascript
let factor = 2
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

let computedNumbers = numbers.map((number) => {
    console.log(number)
    return (number * factor)
})
```

## Best Practices: Objects and Arrays Readability

In an object, ensure that every `key: value` pair is on a new line. This will increase the readability of your code.

Bad:
```javascript
const user = {name: "John Doe", age: 55, address: "Hello World Town"};
```

Good:
```javascript
const user = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 55,
    address: "Hello World Town"
};
```

Bad:
```javascript
const users = [{name: "John Doe", age: 55, address: "Hello World Town"}, {name: "Jane Doe", age: 45, address: "Hello World Town"}, {name: "Jack Doe", age: 15, address: "Hello World Town"}];
```

Bad:
```javascript
const users = [
{name: "John Doe", age: 55, address: "Hello World Town"},
{name: "Jane Doe", age: 45, address: "Hello World Town"},
{name: "Jack Doe", age: 15, address: "Hello World Town"}
];
```

Good:
```javascript
const users = [
    {
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 55,
        address: "Hello World Town"
    },
    {
        name: "Jane Doe",
        age: 45,
        address: "Hello World Town"
    },
    {
        name: "Jack Doe",
        age: 15,
        address: "Hello World Town"
    },
];
```

## Best Practices: Comments

Comments describe ***why*** certain code works the way it does and now what it does.

For example,
```javascript
// Convert the bowlers array of objects into a string
const bowlersJSONData = JSON.stringify(bowlers);`
```

This is fairly obvious to anyone who is familiar with javascript and does not serve any purpose. Hence the comment should be removed.

Similarly, comments that are there for your own understanding such as:
```javascript
const fs = require("fs"); // Internal module
const ipl = require("./ipl"); // Custom module
const csvtojson = require("csvtojson"); // External module
```

serve no purpose to anyone else who reads your code and should be removed. *If you are having difficulty in remembering something about javascript, write it in a notebook for reference later and not in the code.*

A good place to add a comment would be in a place like this:
```javascript
const economicalBowlers = bowlers.sort((bowlerA, bowlerB) => {
    return bowlerA[1] - bowlerB[1];
});
```

In this code, it is not obvious why we are referencing `[1]` in `bowlerA` and `bowlerB`. What value does it contain? ***It is not obvious.***

This is a good reason to write a descriptive comment such as:
```javascript
const economicalBowlers = bowlers.sort((bowlerA, bowlerB) => {
    // [1] contains the economy of the bowler stored as a number
    return bowlerA[1] - bowlerB[1];
});
```

So that anyone else who reads your code can use the comment to immediately understand *why* that code was written in that way.
